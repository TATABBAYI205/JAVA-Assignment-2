Conditional statements in Java:-
===============================
       Conditional statements in Java are used to control the flow of a program based on certain conditions. They allow you to make decisions and execute            
       specific blocks of code based on whether a condition evaluates to true or false. 

       There are three main types of conditional statements in Java.
               -> if Statement: The if statement is the most basic conditional statement. It executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.      
                  syntax :
                     if (condition) 
                     {
                         // Code to be executed if the condition is true
                     }
                 Optionally, you can add an else block to the if statement to specify an alternative block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

               -> if-else Statement: The if-else statement allows you to specify different blocks of code to be executed based on whether a condition is  
                  true or false. 
                  syntax:
                     if (condition) 
                     {
                      // Code to be executed if the condition is true
                     }
                     else
                     {
                     // Code to be executed if the condition is false
                     }
                  Only one of the two blocks (either the if block or the else block) will be executed based on the condition.

               -> if-else if-else Statement: The if-else if-else statement allows you to test multiple conditions and specify different blocks of code to 
                  be executed based on which condition is true. 
                  syntax:
                  if (condition1) 
                  {
                  // Code to be executed if condition1 is true
                  }  
                  else if (condition2) 
                  {
                  // Code to be executed if condition2 is true
                  }      
                  else 
                  {
                  // Code to be executed if no condition is true
                  }
               The conditions are evaluated in order, and as soon as a condition evaluates to true, the corresponding block of code is executed. 
               If none of the conditions are true, the code in the else block is executed.

                The use of conditional statements in Java is essential for implementing decision-making logic in programs. They allow you to control the                
            execution of code based on specific conditions, enabling you to handle different scenarios and make the program more dynamic. Conditional  
            statements are commonly used in tasks such as input validation, error handling, branching logic, and algorithmic decision-making.
