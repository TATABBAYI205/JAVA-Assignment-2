Conditional Operators in java:-
===============================
-> Conditional (ternary) operator:- It is the only ternary operator in Java and has the following syntax: condition ?   
   expression1 : expression2. It evaluates the condition and returns the value of expression1 if the condition 
   is true, otherwise it returns the value of expression2. 

-> Logical AND operator (&&):- It performs a logical AND operation between two boolean expressions and returns 
   true if both expressions evaluate to true; otherwise, it returns false. 

-> Logical OR operator (||):- It performs a logical OR operation between two boolean expressions and returns true
   if at least one of the expressions evaluates to true; otherwise, it returns false. 

    These conditional operators are commonly used in conditional statements, such as if statements and loops, to      
    control the flow of the program based on certain conditions.
