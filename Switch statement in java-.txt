Switch statement in java:-
==========================
      The switch statement in Java is a control statement used for decision-making. It provides an alternative way to write a series of if-else statements  
      when you have multiple options to choose from based on the value of a single expression.

      The switch statement works by evaluating an expression and then matching its value with various cases. Once a matching case is found, the corresponding  
      block of code is executed. The expression inside the switch statement can be of type byte, short, int, char, String, or an enumerated type.

syntax:
======
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Code block to be executed if expression matches value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Code block to be executed if expression matches value2
        break;
    case value3:
        // Code block to be executed if expression matches value3
        break;
    // ...
    default:
        // Code block to be executed if no matching case is found
}
