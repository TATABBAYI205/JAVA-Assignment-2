Comparing two strings in java:
=============================
  In Java the comparision of two Strings are three ways to do ,are

-> Using the equals() method: The equals() method is used to compare the content of two strings. It returns true if the content of the two strings is the    
   same, and false otherwise. 
   example:

    String str1 = "Hello";
    String str2 = "World";

    if (str1.equals(str2)) 
   {
    System.out.println("The strings are equal.");
   } 
   else 
   {
    System.out.println("The strings are not equal.");
   }

   Output: The strings are not equal.

-> Ignoring case: If you want to compare strings while ignoring the case (uppercase or lowercase), you can use the equalsIgnoreCase() method instead of  
   equals(). It performs a case-insensitive comparison. 
   example:

   String str1 = "hello";
   String str2 = "Hello";

   if (str1.equalsIgnoreCase(str2)) 
   {
    System.out.println("The strings are equal.");
   }  
   else 
   {
    System.out.println("The strings are not equal.");
   }

   Output: The strings are equal.

-> Using the compareTo() method: The compareTo() method is used to perform lexicographical comparison of two strings. It returns an integer value that 
   indicates the relative order of the strings. If the result is zero, the strings are equal. If the result is negative, the first string is 
   lexicographically less than the second string. If the result is positive, the first string is lexicographically greater than the second string. 
   example:

   String str1 = "Hello";
   String str2 = "Nature";

   int result = str1.compareTo(str2);
   if (result == 0) 
   {
    System.out.println("The strings are equal.");
   }  
   else if (result < 0) 
   {
    System.out.println("str1 is less than str2.");
   }
   else 
   {
    System.out.println("str1 is greater than str2.");
   }

   Output: str1 is less than str2.
