Operators in Java:-
=================
Based on the number of operands, operators in Java can be classified into the following categories:

Unary Operators: These operators work with a single operand. They can be prefix or postfix operators.

-> Prefix Unary Operators: These operators precede the operand.
   ++ (increment): Increments the value of the operand by 1.
   -- (decrement): Decrements the value of the operand by 1.
   + (unary plus): Represents a positive value.
   - (unary minus): Negates the value of the operand.
   ! (logical NOT): Returns the logical complement of the operand.

-> Postfix Unary Operators: These operators follow the operand. 

   ++ (increment): Increments the value of the operand by 1.
   -- (decrement): Decrements the value of the operand by 1.

Binary Operators: These operators work with two operands. They are the most common type of operators in Java. 

           -> Arithmetic Operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (modulus).

           -> Relational Operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), 
                                    <= (less than or equal to).

           -> Logical Operators: && (logical AND), || (logical OR).

           -> Bitwise Operators: & (bitwise AND), | (bitwise OR), ^ (bitwise XOR), << (left shift), >> (right shift), >>> (unsigned right shift).

           -> Assignment Operators: = (simple assignment), += (add and assign), -= (subtract and assign), *= (multiply and assign), /= (divide and assign), 
                                      %= (modulus and assign), <<= (left shift and assign), >>= (right shift and assign), &= (bitwise AND and assign), 
                                      |= (bitwise OR and assign), ^= (bitwise XOR and assign).
